Consider the Spam dataset from The Elements of Statistical Learning. 

We standardized the data, and also changed the output labels to +/- 1. We then programmed our own nearest-mean classifier from scratch with the following kernels:
* Gaussian RBF
* Polynomial

As output, we plotted the misclassification error on our test set versus multiple kernel hyper-parameters for the two kernels.
