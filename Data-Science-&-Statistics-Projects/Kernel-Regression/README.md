We are performing KDE and kernel regression using the triangle kernel on the faithful dataset found in R, and answer the following prompts

## Part 1
Suppose we use the triangle kernel to construct a KDE of variable waiting. 
Under the Silverman’s rule for choosing the smoothing bandwidth, we plot the estimated density plot

## Part 2
We use the triangle kernel to perform a kernel regression with response variable waiting and covariate eruption. 
Use a 5-fold cross-validation to choose the smoothing bandwidth (repeat at least 100 times)

### Part i
Plot the cross-validation error (under squared distance) versus bandwidth (you need to search within at least h ∈ [0.1, 0.5])

### Part ii
What is the optimal bandwidth you choose?

### Part iii
Make a scatter plot of the two variables along with the fitted regression curve
